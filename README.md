# RedBot - unofficial repo
Unofficial repo for Red-DiscordBot docker container<br/>
Official repo: https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot <br/>

This is under development.<br/>
Im trying to containerize the Red-DiscordBot and make it run on Alpine linux.<br/>
It's working for now, but needs some fine-tuning for now.<br/>

# RedBot - unofficial repo
Unofficial repo for Red-DiscordBot docker container<br/>
Official repo: https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot <br/>

This is working for now, and doesn't need to much tinkering. There will always be room for some improvements.<br/>
I have containerize the Red-DiscordBot and it runs on Alpine linux.<br/>
It's pretty much "set and forget". When there is a new Red-DiscordBot, just pull a new image, that way you will have the newest Alpine and Red-DiscordBot.<br/>

I created this, because I wanted to run the Red-DiscordBot in a container, so I wouldn't have to maintain the bot and the OS myself. Also this is lightweight about 800MB :)
